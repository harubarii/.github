# the heck is this?
sorry for dragging you into this place, but let's be serious:
- students learning or trying to write code might not be having a fun enough time
- students' github profile should be filled with good repos so when they apply nothing happens
- they don't get enough cookies. Yes, you don't get enough cookies.

sounds like you? this place is made so students like you can just drag whatever the heck you want into this organization. Even your silliest code written by a different you when you're exhausted can stay in here.

nobody act on others' repos in here. that is an established rule, y'know?

# any rules?
well, of course, regulations should be in place so nothing goes wrong.

keep these in mind, or you wouldn't be a proper student enjoying the funsies of writing code!
1. respect each other to be a nice community
2. nobody act on others' repo. Whatever they write, they're writing them *for fun*, remember?
3. keep *most* things you write family-friendly. You can swear in your code, we get you, that's understandable. But things not within the scope of common sense is generally not encouraged!
4. as stated, keep it within everyone's common sense. We want to have fun.

anything not within the scope of these rules doesn't mean that it's allowed! if you feel like it's probably not okay, it is not okay to do so!
